The 'The Last Warrior' is a Action Role Playing Game (RPG) with a character involved in a mission. 
The scenario involves a swordsman (our protagonist) fighting enemies (mutants) around the created map, 
with the final motive of defeating the leader of mutants, Gabbar. The entire 'world map' for the game
is the region along which the game would take place. At a given instant, the player would be able to 
see on his screen only a small rectangular section of 'world map' around the hero/protagonist of the game.
